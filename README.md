## Assignments

Each subfolder contains the explaination of the assignment and my final code. Prior to these assignments, I had never worked with Ruby or Rust before, hence the most challenging part of Assignments 1 and 2 were learning a new language in a short period of time.
Each assignment was given inline with a section of the class, in which we covered:
	* Language Syntax (BNF)
	* Lambda Calculus
	* Functional Languages
	* Object Oriented Languages
	* Type Systems
	* Type Inferencing
	* Logic Programming
	* Concurrency
	* Formal Semantics
